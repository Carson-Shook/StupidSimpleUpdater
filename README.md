# StupidSimpleUpdater
StupidSimpleUpdater is a an msi-based updater that is packaged as a merge module for easy integration into your project.

Still working on documentation, but if you want to build it and figure things out for yourself, you will probably want to use the [WiX toolset](http://wixtoolset.org) to build it, but in time I will get everything cleaned up and uploaded.

Thank you for your patience :)
