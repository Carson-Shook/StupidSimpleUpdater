# StupidSimpleUpdater
StupidSimpleUpdater (SSUP) is an msi-based updater system that is packaged as a merge module for easy integration into your project.

SSUP was built to allow applications with msi-installers to be updated from static websites (such as Github Pages). This requires that each msi be a complete installer rather than a patch or delta update. You can download the latest version of the merge-modules and the sample configuration files from the [releases page](https://github.com/Carson-Shook/StupidSimpleUpdater/releases) of this branch.

The easiest way to get SSUP up and running is to follow the instructions and examples found in the links of the Quick Setup section on [the wiki homepage](https://github.com/Carson-Shook/StupidSimpleUpdater/wiki). I am working to make this easier to understand and implement, so if you have any suggestions on ways that the wiki can be improved, please open a new issue, and I will get to it as soon as I can.
